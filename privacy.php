All this information will be kept in a file that is   accessed only by authorized Fluffvision personnel or representatives.</p>
    <p>On some of the Fluffvision Websites, you may choose to use our   referral service to tell a friend or friends about us. In this case, we   will ask you for your friend's name and email address and email your   friend an invite to him or her to visit an Fluffvision Website.</p>
    <p>Providing your Personal Information to us is voluntary.   However, if you do not provide your Personal Information to us, you will   not be able to access some or all of our services.</p>
    <p><a id="sec1_2" name="sec1_2"></a>How do We Use Your Information?</p>
    <p>When you provide Personal Information to us, we will use   it to contact you about our services, to process payment for our   services, and to tailor our services to your meet your preferences.</p>
    <p>We use your Personal Information for many specific purposes, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>emailing you with news and updates about the Fluffvision Websites</li>
      <li>improving and customizing our content and product offerings</li>
      <li>analyzing Fluffvision Website usage and delivering information (such as banners and promotions) targeted to your interests</li>
      <li>providing you with information about the products and services provided by the Fluffvision Websites or third parties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have provided us with certain Personal   Information, we will also use it to facilitate your communication with   other members, for example, by the use of the message center or delivery   of "Cupid Reports" or "Ice Breakers".</p>
    <p>We may also use your Personal Information to resolve   disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce any agreements, policies and   rules governing the use of Fluffvision Websites, and observe the Fluffvision Websites   for quality control and customer service purposes.</p>
    <p>If you use our referral services, we will use your   friend's name and email address only to send an invitation and to track   the status of the referral. Your friend(s) may use the unsubscribe   function in the email or contact us at privacy@your-domain.com   to request that we remove their email address from our records.</p>
    <p><a id="sec1_3" name="sec1_3"></a>When and to Whom Will We Disclose Your Information?</p>
    <p>Due to the nature of many of the services provided by the   Fluffvision Websites, certain of your Personal Information will be disclosed to   other Members. As an example, if you complete a "dating" profile and   choose to disclose your religious affiliation or ethnic origin, this   information will be available to other Members using the services on the   applicable Fluffvision Website. By providing this type of profile information   to us, you have consented to the use and disclosure of your Personal   Information in this manner.</p>
    <p>We may share or transfer your Personal Information with   our subsidiaries operating other Fluffvision Websites so that they can send you   information about their products or services that you may be interested   in.</p>
    <p>We also disclose Personal Information to our service   providers (for example, credit card processing companies, billing   services) as reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide services on   the Fluffvision Websites. Our service providers are legally required by us to   protect your Personal Information. Because many of the Fluffvision Websites   operate or use service providers located in different countries, your   Personal Information may be transferred to a country in which you do not   reside, and while in that foreign country, may be accessible to its law   enforcement authorities.</p>
    <p>We may be required to disclose your Personal Information   in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or a   lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national   security or law enforcement requirements. In addition, we expressly   reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information when we have a   good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, to   enforce our agreements, policies, and rules governing your use of the   Fluffvision Websites, and/or to report information concerning a threat of   serious injury or death.</p>
    <p>We DO NOT sell or rent any of your Personal Information   to third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission   or consent. We may, however, disclose to third-party advertisers certain   aggregated or hashed (i.e., encrypted) information in a manner that no   longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user, for   other marketing and promotional purposes.</p>
    <p>When you provide your Personal Information and Sensitive   Personal Information to us, you consent to our use and disclosure of   that information as described in this Policy. If you do not want us to   use or disclose your Personal Information as described in this Policy,   do not provide it to us. We note that this may result in you being   unable to access some or all of our services.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><a id="sec2" name="sec2"></a>2. Our Use of Cookies and Your Options; Pixel Tags; Do-Not Track</p>
    <p>Fluffvision Websites use "cookies" to store and sometimes track information to make your online experience easier and more personalized.</p>
    <p>Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a   user's web browser on the user's storage drive. Cookies may record   information that is accessed by a user on a webpage in order to simplify   subsequent interactions with that website by the same user, or to   streamline the user's transactions on related webpages. Cookies make it   easier for a user to move from webpage to webpage and to complete   transactions over the Internet.</p>
    <p>Most major web browsers are set up so that they will   initially accept cookies, but you may modify your computer's preferences   to issue you an alert when a cookie is downloaded, or to disable the   ability of third parties to download a cookie to you. If you choose to   reject all cookies, there are areas of Fluffvision Websites that may not function properly. 
    </p>
    <p>We, or a data provider or advertiser that we have   engaged, may also place or recognize a cookie on your browser to enable   you to receive customized ads or content. These cookies contain no   Personal Information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic   or other data that is linked to data that you have voluntarily have   submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with the   data provider or advertiser solely in a hashed (i.e., non-human   readable) format. 
    </p>
    <p>We may also use standard Internet technology, such as web   beacons or 1x1 "gifs" and other similar technologies (collectively   "Pixel Tags"). A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel   (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Members and may be associated   with cookies on the Members' storage drives. We use Pixel Tags to track   your use of the Fluffvision Websites, for advertising, marketing, or promotional   purposes, and to determine whether you opened an email message from us.   The information also enables us to customize the services we offer.</p>
    <p>Other parties may collect Personal Information about your   online activities over time and across different websites when you use   Fluffvision Services. We honor web browser "do not track" signals that provide   you with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of   Personal Information about your online activities over time and across   third-party websites or online services, when the web browser's http   header includes the field "dnt:1". We do not presently honor any other   types of "Do Not Track" mechanism.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><a id="sec3" name="sec3"></a>3. Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information by Third Parties</p>
    <p>This Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of   Personal Information that we collect from you. To the extent that you   disclose your Personal Information to others while using the Fluffvision   Websites or other websites throughout the internet, different rules may   apply to its use, maintenance, or disclosure.

We reserve the right to   terminate those who misuse other Members' information or who otherwise   violate any user agreements, policies, or rules governing the use of any   Fluffvision Website.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><a id="sec5" name="sec1"></a>5. A Special Note About Children.</p>

    <p>Please DO NOT post, share or disclose in public forums   (e.g., chat rooms, blogs) any Personal Information that you do not wish   other Members to know. We encourage you to ask questions before you   disclose your Personal Information to others. Similarly, you should   never disclose or share your password with anyone else. If you lose   control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your   Personal Information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken   on your behalf. If your password has been compromised for any reason,   you should immediately change your password and/or contact us via our contact page.</p>

    <p>Fluffvision Websites use reasonable security measures to help   protect and prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information   under our control. We use industry standard efforts, such as firewalls,   to safeguard your Personal Information. While "perfect security" does   not exist on the Internet, or elsewhere, our technical staff works hard   to help ensure your secure use of our services.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><a id="sec8" name="sec8"></a>8. Where we are Located</p>

    <p>When you use the Fluffvision Websites, you consent to us   transferring your Personal Information (which includes, for the   avoidance of doubt, your Sensitive Personal Information) from your   country to the United States or countries in which the Fluffvision or its   service providers are located for the purposes described in this Policy.</p>
